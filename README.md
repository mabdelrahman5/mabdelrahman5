- 👋 Hi, I’m mabdelrahman5, but you can call me Mohamed :)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about different programming careers, especially in fields of cybersecurity and data analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but moving into HTML and JavaScript over the summer, and hopefully C over my next semester.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can branch me out into new understandings and learning more about different coding languages and experiences.
- 📫 How to reach me: Email - m.abdelrahman1704@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've had no coding experience before 2023, so this is a completely new space for me! I hope this community can welcome me :)
